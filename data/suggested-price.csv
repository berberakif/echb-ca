Same as the 4th G
Should stay the same

1500
Same as for this year if number of modules stay the same.
2000 euro
Price is okay
"Tricky question because the real value of the price it’s always individual because it’s always set by customers expectations which are based on their personal experiences, motivations and financial situation   So from my perspective I would diplomatically say that the price for another generations without any significant changes in the program should remain the same."
 Same if possible
Really don’t know
