Please share any additional comments or suggestions about Networking. 
I belive there should have been designated seats depnding in the participants. Ehcb students shoud have been separated from other coaches. Ehcb students shoud have special meetings with ehcb coaches memberes in order to have more time to get knowledge from them.
I did not participate to Congress so I put 3 on those questions. Kinda neutral
Did not attend the congres
I didn’t attend 
Great thing with the live stream for those who were not able to attend. 
I could not make congress due to the birth of my daughter but the online was fantastic
"I didn’t get to attend the congress but following along online. Everything looked great, the content was surely beneficial and I’m sure people made lasting relationships from it. "

It should be great if there was something like an HR desk there in order to file your CV or maybe take some guidance for the future etc 
"No AC in the arena. It was extremely hot in the afternoon. The schedule didn't allow a proper lunch break. There could have been some networking activity or tools in place to meet coaches based on what we're looking for. We couldn't really meet the Euroleague coaches after the sessions (just briefly).
Nothing was organized for us after the sessions. We were on our own. "

the 2024 was my second congress (2023 first) I would try to make the 2025 for sure. 
"Again, great job in the Congress everything was perfect and very satisfying. I think one of the best experience I ever had."
I have not participated and couldn't watch the live stream. 
More structured 
"I couldn’t attend the congress, but I watched the live stream and I think it was really good, the atmosphere of the congress, and visiting the top level coaches and learning from them was perfect "
"As I said, I thought it would be different, 4th generation student's could be together over the congress, or have one big moment just us to discuss something specific, maybe discussion about experience in practice weeks,  some dynamics to socialize. I had much more network with ""others"" than with the students. To be honest this was the most frustrating part, even more because some of them already knew each other because of practice week and It was really different be part of the small groups "
4th Generation was awesome
"Unfortunately I was not able to attend the Congress, hopefully next year."
It's great !
Please do NOT consider my answers regarding the congress because I was not able to attend! 
It would have been nice to have your name called out even if you missed the congress . 
"Improve the schedule, for example having enough time to have lunch. Also it would be great to have more exclusivity for the EHCB Academy students, for us to feel that world class basketball ourselves. Having opportunities to meet and talk exclusively with EHCB members would be amazing"
I saw the congress online and was not in person 
"I was little bit disappointed about no difference aproach to the generations students and only congress visitors. I literally felt like it means nothing there to studying in the program for months in comparison to whoever who just pay and come for the congress.  No blame or regrets, but honestly it felt little bit dehonestating for the students. 

And of course, I missed more interactivity between lectors and attendees, absence of moderating of discussions and it all due to not using available tools and technologies."
Specific networking event with a drink and the coaches/students there
"It was a feeling that a few of the Students had ""a better treatment"" than others.

It could have been organized a social event for the 4th generation."
I think Congress was really great
I was unable to attend the congress this year due to national team commitments. 
"I would have expected a different ""atmosphere"" especially in terms of interaction with the Members. Only chance we had to chat with them was while they were waiting for their busses to get away from us :) Having the congress in a bigger gym instead of the hotel where the coaches are staying probably had this kind of disadvantage. But with some additional arrangements (maybe designated drinks at the end of everyday or with a some small event with simple lunch in the beginning of the Congress) this problem could have been tackled. 

Additionally, Congress should provide at least some simple catering like water/coffee/sandwich etc. (doesn't even need to be free). Especially when the lunch break was shorter due to some extended lectures, it was very difficult to find a solution for food/drinks. "
