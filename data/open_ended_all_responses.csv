Training Weeks
One of the most important periods, the Program offers in my opinion and thank you for this opportunity.
- Each Team/Coach has different approach to this, which somehow doesn't make it fair to everyone. For example Weeks in Real, Partizan, Monaco and Red Star, as far as I know, were by far the best.
I suggest you set a minimum of specific things that a Team/Coach can offer to the students that participate. For example:
At least one Scouting/VIdeo Session.
Time spent with Players and Coaching Staff.
At least one member of the Coaching Staff or a member of EHCB who would be in charge to explain what is happening during the practices.
Meetings and spend time with other departments of groups of people that a Head Coach is cooperating with like physios, doctors, management team.
Tour in the locker rooms and the facilities.
During the games seats near the bench in order for the students to have a better picture of ingame coaching.
My experience with Olympiacos, as we had already informed you back then, was not what we were expecting.
We were standing behind the baseline just watching the sessions, no one from the EHCB or the coaching staff was there to explain anything to us, except the last day at the end of the practice.
We did not have any video sessions or meetings with players.

I would suggest agreeing with each Coach and each team about the period of the weeks that they will be more beneficial. For example, there are Coaches, like Coach Bartzokas, that maybe they would prefer to have the students during the preseason. It is something that Coach Bartzokas also suggested.

The most unpleasant was when one day when everyone had left the stadium, one of the students (who probably privately asked coach Triantafyllos), had a private Scouting/Video session for about 40-45 minutes, with scouting reports provided etc.
He did share everything with us, and I thank him, but it is totally different than having a session with a member of the coaching staff.
Obviously, it was a genuine mistake and not something intentionally.",3,"There were not equal oportunities for all the Students to meet and discuss with the members of EHCB. It is part of the life, that if you know someone, you have better approach.
Unfortunately, I do not have any suggestions on how to imporve this.",Yes,"Resume, Minimum # of years of experience, Coaching Licence Level, I suggest a Test (like the one we have during the season), before the start of the Programm each season, would be more fair than a video creation.","Website, Phone Call Interview","Q&A, Topic based","Instant questions allowed, Questions in the end or seperate session","Evaluation of Coaches background.

,,I was unable to attend the congress this year due to national team commitments. ,,,I was unable to attend a practice week due to the scheduling of my academy. ,5,"The EHCB Coaches Academy's 4th Generation program has been an exceptional experience. The updated curriculum provided a comprehensive and immersive learning journey. Despite not being able to attend the congress this year as I did last year, I heard a lot of positive feedback from the coaches and gained valuable insights from their presentations.

The new modules, such as EuroLeague Assistant Coaches Scouting and Strength & Conditioning Coaches Lectures, have significantly expanded our knowledge base, offering cutting-edge insights. The program's structure, with a mix of online lectures and in-person sessions, allowed us to balance our daily work while advancing our coaching skills.

The academic partnership with the University of Belgrade and the involvement of EHCB members have elevated the quality of education, making it one of the premier coaching programs globally. The EHCB Coaches Congress, as reported by my peers, featured engaging panel discussions, masterclasses, and invaluable networking opportunities.

I highly recommend the EHCB Coaches Academy to anyone serious about advancing their coaching career.

"Website form needs some updates. As I remember it was not the most user friendly form. 

Also maybe another small research could be done for selection criterias/procedure and implemented with help of some HR experts or industrial psychologists (if possible from the alumnis) to convert this process almost like a ""hiring"" process with different mechanism. First deciding the ""profiles"" / ""roles"" needed and then selecting from the candidates. Goal would be keeping quality high but at the same time keeping the variety. Because I really liked  seeing very young coaches, very experienced coaches, coaches from countless different countries, cultures etc. Academy should be always open to everyone who really wants and who would give its due, who would give the value it deserves. ","Maybe something like a ""graduation project"" could be added to the curriculum. Probably not possible to do it per individuals but for the first year, as a trial, pre-defined projects are offered to everyone then everyone selects one  from the topics (S&C, Psychology, Technology, Anatomy, Scouting...). Some of them could be even related to the Academy itself. Helping the staff from technical perspective or operational perspective might be a good experience for the students as well (IT work group, Practice Weeks work group, Congress Work group etc.). Or the students come up with ideas/proposals. This would create a real self sufficient community, more hands on experiences, more interactions, more impact to everyone and in my opinion would be more chance to teach everyone from the youngest coach to the most experienced national team level coaches. It would create more internship or even finding a job kind of chances in natural and mutual way. 

Content/topic wise I liked the curriculum. It was covering almost everything. Whatever would be there, there will be always ""this is also important, should be in the curriculum"" kind of critisizm. On top of the ones I added above, I would also like to see more ""futuristic"" topics (some experimental defenses, some unorthodox spacing ideas or the way of technology usage in NBA like leagues, latest academic studies on timing or mental health or you name it) as well for example. But I also strongly believe that having a nice stable curriculum and the foundation of the academy and then shaping it without rushing is the best way to create the excellence. So that's why I really liked that everything was based on Yugoslavian school and decided by the academicians of its representatives. However, I would shape it in a way that it covers both ""old school"" and ""new school"" if I can summarize roughly like that. And the way of managing it is keeping the foundation for sure, while adding different perspectives. That's why maybe instead of having the lectures as ""whole package"" from the Belgrade University, spreading this curriculum to the whole europe and all different ""basketball schools"" in Europe. 

  ","I would have expected a different ""atmosphere"" especially in terms of interaction with the Members. Only chance we had to chat with them was while they were waiting for their busses to get away from us :) Having the congress in a bigger gym instead of the hotel where the coaches are staying probably had this kind of disadvantage. But with some additional arrangements (maybe designated drinks at the end of everyday or with a some small event with simple lunch in the beginning of the Congress) this problem could have been tackled. 

Additionally, Congress should provide at least some simple catering like water/coffee/sandwich etc. (doesn't even need to be free). Especially when the lunch break was shorter due to some extended lectures, it was very difficult to find a solution for food/drinks. ","I liked the lectures a lot even though I couldn't attend most of them. But to me it didn't look professional to ask extra money and create some ""exclusiveness"" in the Academy. I would prefer having those lectures already part of the Academy lessons and if needed paying that extra together with the Academy fee. ","To me  the biggest technical problem was having different sources of communication, need of lots of different tools but mainly for the calendar. The calendar we had was great until it was not updated anymore. Additionally a ""dynamic"" calender that you can link with your phone/personal calendar would have been great. 

Mobile App was apperantly not sufficient but I know it is an ongoing process, so I skip the app related feedback.

About the operational manners, what I missed the most was the ""community spirit"". I was expecting more collaboration with the alumnis and the students. Some responsibilities could have given to a ""team"" of ambassadors or alumnis maybe instead of having just one person. An extended team cooperating with Jelena and distributing the responsibilities and communication would have made her also way more efficient and keep the interactions smoother. That's why related to this topic again; having study groups, practice week captains, work groups,  operational team etc. kind of ideas would create a self sufficient and dynamic community which would operate smoothly with combination of great help from dedicated (crazy) people like Jelena :) ","I saw two complete different parts of practice weeks. One was very well organized and with a  dedicated representative from EHCB (Real Madrid with Goran) and the other one was not organized at all and without a dedicated representative from EHCB (Panathinaikos). I will just repeat my suggestion for the sake of being recorded: there should be a check list of things what can teams/coaches offer to the visitor students and what they cannot. Then at least everyone can know upfront what they should expect. From Pao week, personally I already had expected no more communication than what we had (basically Hi & Bye only) with Coach Ataman but I think it is a shame that we couldn't even had a simple Q&A session with him. This kind of details (making him available) are the ""exclusiveness"" feeling that EHCB should try to create for their students. 

But anyways I enjoyed both experiences A LOT from all dimensions. Interaction with assistent coaches of both teams, Coach Mateo, all co-students and Goran was amazing. Lunch with Coach Itoudis was a great additional surprise. ",2,"Maybe it looked like I criticized a lot but all because I would like see that it just gets better in the upcoming generations. I LOVED being part of it and completely satisfied. I enjoyed everything, found something to enjoy with every dimension of it and had zero regrets about the time/money/energy I spent for it. Friendships and memories I collected are priceless. I already suggest it to the coaches that I know and would like to keep being part of it one way or another. 

Special thanks to everyone and their dedication who were part of it, starting with Goran and Jelena!",Yes,"Resume, Recommendation Letter, Some level of on court skills are needed probably for screening but I would add “a decent level of communication skills” and “will to share with community” instead of just seeing this as a ""service I am paying for"" should be somehow considered as criteria.

",Website,"Q&A, Topic based, Maybe collecting ideas already in the beginning of the season from the students in terms of topics, like saying ""I would like to hear Match-up zone from Coach X because they have the best efficiency"". And collecting the questions already maybe one week before from the students and share them with everyone so everyone can rate the questions, then the best rated ones are directed to the coaches.  ","Direct questions to the students, Instant questions allowed, Questions in the end or seperate session, More like a video cast, one way communication to watch it later, Everyone has their own style, but if there is no change in the content or no interactivity is needed then maybe better to just have the video of the topic explained by teachers. Then after everyone watches that video, a live questions/answers session with the teacher would be more efficient. And maybe one more session after the “quiz”. Then the challenge of “having coaches with very different knowledge level” would be tackled a bit more. ","If possible, not much more than what it was. But clearly there is some extra budget needed to make it even better.","Sport Management, Sports Psychology, Sports Technology, Pedagogy"
