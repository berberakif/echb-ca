"Resume, Recommendation Letter, Some level of on court skills are needed probably for screening but I would add “a decent level of communication skills” and “will to share with community” instead of just seeing this as a ""service I am paying for"" should be somehow considered as criteria. And in my opinion the most important criteria should be ""will to join this Academy"". Rest will always come if someone really wants to join, learn from and share with the Academy. "
