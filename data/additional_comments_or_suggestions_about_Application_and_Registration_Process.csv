Keep doing what your doing to improve basketball over the word .. and for sure keep people like jelena talking to the coaches 
More practice week
Everything was perfect
I would say that senior coaches should have separated clinic level in order to have all the same interest in learning or questioning. 
None 
Provide the information on the approx length (1.5-2 hrs) and content of the lectures. 
It's was great experience for me as a yang coach 
I didn t knew we could pay in 2 or 3 instalment payments
The call with Jelena helped me a lot to learn more about the academy and how will the whole process unfold . I believe it will be easier for the staff of the academy if some of those instructions were sent into a video format through email to save them time and decrease the number of questions coaches will have.

The applicants should prove their relation with the sport and expound their intentions about their application.
ALL WAS PERFECT

Better navigation on the website
You may start to use guys from previous generations for interviews) but still continue interviewing with Jelena)
"Provide way to pay online,"
I appreciated the process. I trusted the process. 
"If I watch the videos on the app i need to touch my screen in every 10 seconds, the phone don't know the video format of the app. "
Ceep it the same
Promotion start for 5th Generation in social media to be started 1 month earlier than 2023
None
Keep in touch with the federations 
I like the process at all
I think that before all candidates fall into Jelena or Amit's hands would be good to have pre-screening call with alumnis who are good enough to do that kind of an interview.
"it could be more transparent, clearer and more strict "
Onboarding pack would save you questions. Also it should contain exactly what is covered and other info
Talking with coaches' clubs managers
"Website form needs some updates. As I remember it was not the most user friendly form. 

Also maybe another small research could be done for selection criterias/procedure and implemented with help of some HR experts or industrial psychologists (if possible from the alumnis) to convert this process almost like a ""hiring"" process with different mechanism. First deciding the ""profiles"" / ""roles"" needed and then selecting from the candidates. Goal would be keeping quality high but at the same time keeping the variety. Because I really liked  seeing very young coaches, very experienced coaches, coaches from countless different countries, cultures etc. Academy should be always open to everyone who really wants and who would give its due, who would give the value it deserves.
