"Questions in the end or seperate session, More like a video cast, one way communication to watch it later, A video cast and one Q&A live session with smaller groups could be an idea. However, due to my fulltime job I was not always able to join libe classes, so this could be just me."

"Direct questions to the students, Instant questions allowed, again tricky question, it depends on many factors - I was studying at the university to get my diploma which get me some kind of privilege - so it was serious and student have to obey profs rules and do something and from that perspective it should be more demanding for students. But in the other hand, if the perspective of this program is more like more voluntary knowledge sharing platform, my answer would be different here. "

"Direct questions to the students, Instant questions allowed, Questions in the end or seperate session, More like a video cast, one way communication to watch it later, Everyone has their own style, but if there is no change in the content or no interactivity is needed then maybe better to just have the video of the topic explained by teachers. Then after everyone watches that video, a live questions/answers session with the teacher would be more efficient. And maybe one more session after the “quiz”. Then the challenge of “having coaches with very different knowledge level” would be tackled a bit more. "
