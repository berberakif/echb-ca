Please share any additional comments or suggestions. 
Thanks for everything
The EHCB provides an excellent opportunity to learn for Coaches of all levels.  The first rate instruction from qualified professionals cannot be matched.

Definitly I will join again... next generation
It was great opportunity to be connected with international coaches from land of Japan. Iâ€™d like to keep in touch those people for long time. 
In my opinion EHCB 4th generation was success!!!
It was wonderful
nothing
At the congress coaches should have special meetings with ehcb members in order to get mor knowledge 1v1 questioning 
I loved it. Had to watch lectures afterwards because my practices were most of the time at the same time with lectures. But I think it was good. It gave me more to think the topics
"Well done, I cannot wait for the next year to start. "
Special thanks to Jelena Todorovic 
Keep it on
"A great experience for us and for you as an academy... I believe that we have all progressed and that we have seen the shortcomings that should improve us.  My suggestion is to increase the number of staff in the organization, to describe more precisely the practice weeks and the obligations of all participants (students, clubs, staff)... it can always be better, I believe that it will be."
It was great
I have made the comments before. Anything else was really good.
Was great experience 
None
I would like to suggest to enter some group case studies during the lectures 
"Overall, a fantastic experience with the EHCB Academy. A really well organised programme for coaches aspiring to be at the professional level. I would highly recommend the program to others."
"Lots of the content was repetition for me from a previous course, but it is good  while pther content was new and very giving especially when it comes to scouting and S&C. Good with new collaborations and new future opportunities for the upcoming generations. Many colleagues have asked me about the program and I have suggested it to some of them. "
I hope we can make these also for Asian Market and have more students next year ðŸ’ª
I already know at least 2 Irish coaches that are thinking of applying for next years academy.
"I suggest EHCB promote more group work for the students, which would create more connections between them."
Going to be an ambassador again next year
I would like to have the nba option
Great job!
Cant thank the team enough 
"The practice week was the best basketball experience in my life.
This is the most significant section."
It was a great experience and definitely it helped me to become a better coach and also to realize that I want to improve more and more
"up until now I can t add nothing more,"
R
I love the fact that we meet so many coaches from all over the world and instantly connect because of the love we have for the game. This academy has opened so many doors to all of us with the connections we have created and it will be amazing to see how we can use it in the future and to organize different things between us 
"I have already recommended this academy to a number of my colleagues! Being a part of this academy changed my whole perspective on coaching and allowed me a lens into how basketball is taught, coached and played in Europe. This academy has made me a better coach and teacher. I hope to continue to network and build relationships with the people I met and will meet in the future."

"My suggestion would be to introduce somewhat of a department that can guide coaches for further improvement in matters like technical knowledge (using basketball software much needed nowadays), seminars of experts such as individual trainers etc and maybe an office that can help coaches find job vacancies."
Nothing to add
"I will appreciate it if during the practice week we can be more involved , and be closer to the team especially in game days "
"Better English speaking professors from Belgrade uNi, better organization on the congress for the students, better package(it looked like just to get rid of us t-shirt)on the registration, you should ve  make one-2 locals where students get discount not just for the money but also everyone would go there, one organized dinner would Ve been nice also at the beginning "
None 
"Make the program more exclusive, I mean better selection of the students."
"The access to the video platform is great. 

Suggestions:
- connect coaches together based on what they're looking for (online and on site at the congress)
- don't add paid sessions on the go 
- mentor or guide the students to advance in their career"
better system for sharing PDF will be good for next generation
EHCB Is not only about basketball is about connecting with colleagues and share basketball knowledge 
Everything was perfect.

It was Great
Already in other sections 
There was minimal interaction during lectures 
Thank you for everything 
I was overall very happy. It was hard doing this and guiding my team for the first time in the top division and especially tough in the playoffs and final 4 in the cup (to balance everything). So that is the biggest hurdle in my mind.
EHCB should add a yearly membership fee and a member card with access to the names and contract of the other member. 
The EHCB Academy provides a content-rich course as well as great networking with some of the best professionals in the industry. I hope it continues to grow and help develop the beautiful game of basketball all over the world
.
Forum in the website to discuss in a more organized way 
I appreciated the oppression 
"The practice week could be more interactive, like coaches not only watch team practices but  participate in some of them , and prepare a session to coach youth team for example , kind of practice exams where every coach must do his real work and show what he knows about basketball and coaching "
Definitely will suggest it (and already did) to other persons. It was a great experience
"From my experience in similar training programmes, I think that the approach to the subjects is excellent and comprehensive. 
High level in each subject scientifically documented. 
Perhaps the Academy should even consider creating a postgraduate degree in basketball coaching. 
Iam grateful for the experience!"

Nothinâ€™
All good and professional 
More specific zoom session with the coaches with topic and in the and Q&A session. 
Thank you
"I would like to have less detailed academic lectures since we studied in university and focus more on basketball lectures even more exams about technical and tactical topics
I am grateful to be one of the participants in this program !"
Go to the same  way :-) 
Ad some credits to the certificate 
"Everything was great, just about practice week, if it would be more organized for EHCB coaches to get the most out of it for the next generations, it would be perfect and we can gain and learn much more things from that..
Thank you,
Best regards"
"As a young coach, that was an amazing opportunity. I'm trying to learn from anyone as much as I can, and here I gain a lot of knowledge "
More tactical lectures
"EHCB 4th generation was indeed a great experienced and had gave me a great impact in life opening doors for me in the Gambia and other Countries in Africa like Ghana. I'll suggest for the dates and venue of the congress to announce 3 months prior to the event, making it easy for us coaches especially in Africa to book an appointment in the embassy earlier because having appointment to European countries is always difficult. Thank you "
"Maybe for European people is much more valuable to participate, everything is closer and there are more chances to participate and interact with the big group. Again the importance to have something different for students in the congress, I was talking with some friends about the EHCB and congress and they said I'm not going to do the whole thing cause I saw some people participating in congress without being students. But in the and the investment was good, experience was good, I think it worth the most."
Iâ€™d love to become an ambassador and also work for EHCB CA
"Maybe to find a way to ""reward"" the best students (based on the exams / homeworks, in person meetings at the practice weeks / congress interaction) and maybe offer them one more ""practice week"" or to be the part of the staff of one Euroleague team during their training camp (like Nba summer league). 
Where us, ""young coaches"" could actually coach and be a part of the staff for few days and have more closer / individual interactions and communications with Eurolague coaches / assistant coaches. 
Of course, all of us are ""dreaming"" to one day get to that level, to show our skills, our knowledge and potential, so maybe EHCB could become a platform where you get a chance to make your dreams come true :) 
"
No!
Keep up the good work.
None
Better facility with working aircondition in gym for next congres. 
Thank youuuuuuuu !
No
"Overall due to the classes, the bonus lectures and the people met I increased my basketball knowledge and became more professional. Also running late in Kaunas and receive a very bad look from Coach Andrea Trincheri made me respect the time a lot more ;)"
providing  job offers or being a volunteer coaches in the preseason will add more knowledge  and benefits for students
"It was a great experience and the wealth of knowledge from the coaches , lecturers and refs was immense."
Thanks for everything and for your development!
Definitely coming back as alumni to gather more knowledge 
"EHCB has definitely made me a better coach and person. I really enjoyed it from the first til the last day, especially the practice week and Congress. I have made some great connections with the students and colleagues, and for sure I will continue my further education with EHCB. My suggestion would be regarding modules. Leave them as they are, do not add or change anything. For example, the last month of academy was very busy and dynamic with the lessons and Q&A sessions, bonus lectures, etc, because many of them were cancelled during the course. The last day of congress should be the last day for all activities at the academy. And one more suggestion, the coach of the Euroleague Champion (if he is a member of EHCB) has to say hello to the students during the zoom meeting on the first day of the EHCB course."
"Would be great to have more events and activities to enhance and help networking for all coaches. Also, decrease the number of students would help to improve this topic"
"No direct contact was made for me with EuroLeague coaches, while I need a mentor to continue my coaching journey."
Excellent opportunity for everyone who wants to work in any piece of the basketball.
Practice weeks should happen during pre season
"Instead of covering the topic with monologue, professors should try to find how to interact more with students. In my opinion, some of the lectures were really boring. The others, was much better because of the professors character. That makes big difference. Some of the topic can be more interactive, maybe you should try to find/create the other apps, where students can solve some tasks, create and work out different situations related to topic. Based on the answers lessons can run. While discussing mistake and different point of views. That way can bring more attention from students and the most important, learning process can double up."
"thank you for what you doing, I am unbelievably happy to had an opportunity to spend time with you all and for what you just have provided for me. It was one of the best experiences of my life, because for some few months I felt fulfilled with energizing happiness. Tbh, especially in mirror of what I was coming through last year in my life, this program, the feeling of being part of  EHCB was very often the only one thing which fueled me on and made me smile a little. I am not kidding right now and I donâ€™t want be too sentimental, but seriously, EHCB was like a family for me in last months and I am really thankful to you. Please be sure, that when congress ends, I felt nothing but sadness because I realized, itâ€™s just over. So please, keep doing what you do, keep growing as a organisation (I see unbelieve potential of product what you have) and keep giving us the opportunities to feel like a just felt last few months. In these days, whole sociaty need it. Hope there will be some opportunities to stay in touch with EHCB, because itâ€™s awesome. "
"Exit opportunities clarified, sufficient notice for lectures, more group tasks"
"In general, I think this is great program! I received much more than I expected! 
For me it is just a pity that I missed my practice weak as I canâ€™t go for that long away during the season. 
The Congress was absolutely amazing! Program at the Congress was on the highest level and Glyfada was fantastic! "
"There were not equal oportunities for all the Students to meet and discuss with the members of EHCB. It is part of the life, that if you know someone, you have better approach.
Unfortunately, I do not have any suggestions on how to imporve this."
I really like my experience studying in EHCB. I had a lot of chances to learn and also to build networking . Thanks a lot
It was a nice experience I would recommend to everyone 
It was worth it 
Itâ€™s a good experience 
Create more zoom calls to discuss about basketball just between alumni 
"The EHCB Coaches Academy's 4th Generation program has been an exceptional experience. The updated curriculum provided a comprehensive and immersive learning journey. Despite not being able to attend the congress this year as I did last year, I heard a lot of positive feedback from the coaches and gained valuable insights from their presentations.

The new modules, such as EuroLeague Assistant Coaches Scouting and Strength & Conditioning Coaches Lectures, have significantly expanded our knowledge base, offering cutting-edge insights. The program's structure, with a mix of online lectures and in-person sessions, allowed us to balance our daily work while advancing our coaching skills.

The academic partnership with the University of Belgrade and the involvement of EHCB members have elevated the quality of education, making it one of the premier coaching programs globally. The EHCB Coaches Congress, as reported by my peers, featured engaging panel discussions, masterclasses, and invaluable networking opportunities.

I highly recommend the EHCB Coaches Academy to anyone serious about advancing their coaching career. The knowledge, experience, and connections gained through this program are truly transformative, positioning it at the forefront of basketball coaching education."
"EHCB is a great organisation and academy is great. You need to decide which road take in order to provide a better experience. Keep it for everyone (as I prefer) or just for professional.
That will change all of the organisation and of course the price"
"Maybe it looked like I criticized a lot but all because I would like see that it just gets better in the upcoming generations. I LOVED being part of it and completely satisfied. I enjoyed everything, found something to enjoy with every dimension of it and had zero regrets about the time/money/energy I spent for it. Friendships and memories I collected are priceless. I already suggest it to the coaches that I know and would like to keep being part of it one way or another. 

Special thanks to everyone and their dedication who were part of it, starting with Goran and Jelena!"
