Please share any additional comments or suggestions about the Schedule and Attandance. 
Honestly it was difficult to join and catch up all info with daily work (scouting and plan practice) with time difference. But archives helped me a lot. 
Was tough for me at attend but was able to watch them after which was great 
 A you create a ICal link so the schedule can be exported to your iPhone. Same with the exam dates
"I think scheduling for this programme is incredibly difficult. In one way, I think consistency of days, times would be better, yet I also understand the idea that changing the days/times allows others to attend."
The lectures schedule fitted in most of the times in well with my work and practice schedule. 
For me it's hard to be live on zoom sometimes when is lecture after 17:00 European time but I can watch lecture latter so it's fine...
With trainings and work it was very hard to be at every lecture but the recordings were very good to have.
"It’s impossible make everyone happy, unfortunately I couldn’t attend all class because of my Timezone."
"maybe if we can have a clear schedule about the euroleague coaches class,so we can arrange our week schedule so we can attend ."
Overall the fact that we could watch the lectures whenever we had time in case we missed them was an amazing thing and it helped me out a lot with not missing loads of information.
The schedule was great and recordings helped out a ton.

"The EHCB Calendar leaves no room for any misunderstanding, Coaches should just stick in to it "
Practice time 18:00
FOR MY TIMEZONE SOME LECTURES WERE DURING 6PM-7PM which was a struggle to follow 
/
Overall pretty good) I was just too busy this year)
I understand majority of the attendees are in Europe but it would be great to consider other times that accommodate more attendees 
I felt that because of my timezone I fell behind and missed alot of lectures
"The schedule was tough, most part of the classes I had to re-watch later because the time zone and work time... so I had to push myself to get it, but I wish I could watched live."
I felt that EHCB staff (especially Jelena) did the most possible to please most of us with the schedules
None
The Schedule is rich ! Attendance must be necessary at least the half of all lectures especially Academicones ( recorded lecture is a must)
"Like I already mentioned, for me it was tough to join most of the live sessions especially during the week. Though the scheduling will remain an impossible task due to full time jobs or coaches team schedules, games on evenings and weekends, etc"
"For me,it will be better if the lectures stars later during the week"
"It is difficult to attend lessons on weekdays as per team practices, maybe on weekends would be easier to attend the lectures"
"more transparent
more planned 
more approachable 
more connective 

for example I really really missed the open calendar link to connect, diversity of acces platforms especially with unclear schedule with many changes just drove me crazy sometimes "
"Attendance was low, even on the deck for oly week i offered to do, noone attended from my oly peers. Academic ones were low on numbers as sometimes is difficult to follow, so you might want to consider pre recorded videos instead"
"- Dates and times of lectures, Q&A sessions and Tests were not always updated, which caused a bit of confusion and a lot of spamming on the chat. Many messages were lost in the group chat because of irrelevant messages that could have been sent privately.
- Teams should have been the second source of checking for the Tests' deadlines, since we had a link of Exam Topics-Dates. I have missed one test unfortunately. The one I asked you the questions which were included.
- Regarding missing Tests, I suggest adding from the next season, a week or 10 days when you can open all tests for those that have missed one or more. It is more fair than extending the deadline just for a few tests, because someone asked for it. Personally, when I missed the test, I accepted the consequences. I just wanted to know the questions that the test had for my personal use.
- Last moment invitations (for example the next day), it's difficult to be attended."
Last minute organisatio. Was the most bothering part.  As said this kind of timetable is hard to follow for who is no in Europe or for who is working. So if the EHCB want to stay open for unprofessional coaches this could change in provided lecture
"There were some rough weeks, lots of last moment changes, even some things had to be done after the Congress but I think it is practically impossible to make a perfect schedule. I think two things should be done related to this topics:
- Attendance should be encouraged (somehow), at least attandance data should be analysed with different factors (time of the year/season, time of the day, lesson type, teacher etc.)
- Schedule could be dynamic with last minute changes but it has to be announced from one unique source, from a nicely arranged calendar from which you can see the recorded sessions, upcoming sessions and that you can link with your calendar accounts and follow easily. "
