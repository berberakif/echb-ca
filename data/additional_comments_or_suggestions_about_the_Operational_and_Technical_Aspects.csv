Please share any additional comments or suggestions about the Operational and Technical Aspects. 
"Yigit was very present and helpful with the uploading of the lectures and documents plus present during the lectures when Jelena was absent. 

Jelena did her best organzing the lectures, meetings and providing the necessary information. Unfortunately, she is not responsable for students reading and organization skills. "
No issues at all
"Everything was ran great and if there was any issue, it was fixed right away."

Communicating on WhatsApp is a no go. Use Slack or Discord with dedicated channels for clarity. Links to Zoom meetings were lost in the WhatsApp chat. The tone of communication was very often not professional or judgmental. The recordings were not always on the webpage. Very poor communication effectiveness despite the effort of Jelena and the team. They need the right tools in my opinion.

I saw how it was improving throughout the year) just continue)
Microsoft teams communication with regards to tests and availability was not really functioning great and the time zone was also an issue. Finally got it solved but it took a while 
It was great having a WhatsApp group to communicate with other coaches. But sometimes it was hard to keep up.
"Yigit and Gabor did a very good job, we were in good hands all the way. "
There was alot of places to get the information from
"Nothing to say, great job from all the support Stuff always were ready to help without delays.great job"
WhatsApp should be replaced by a more professional communication platform 
The link of recorded lectures doesn't work after we are finished the program  
N/a
"I would like communication channels to be more effective and clear. Whatsapp groups are difficult to follow, but are really great for interaction between coaches"
"When we entered the class 5 or 10 minutes late, we could not be added to the panel list!  And since Jelena was angry with the student for asking for the panel list several times, I preferred to be in the class outside of the panel list or I would request yit and I would see a respectful behavior."
it would be really long list
Whatsapp doesnt work great due to the volume of messages and people spamming. Not easy for the organisers either. Sometimes people dont check phones and might miss important messages. A platform would be great but it comes at a cost.
"A lot of spamming in WhatsApp chat which doesn't help to find anything you need.
Using WhatsApp is dangerous if someone's change mobile device. It's easy to lose the whole chat and additionally you are not able to see what was writtern before you ender the chat.

As mentioned before:
Teams should have been the second source of checking for the Tests' deadlines, since we had a link of Exam Topics-Dates. I have missed one test unfortunately. The one I asked you the questions which were included.

Regarding lectures, it should be allowed to be downloaded for personal use."
Reminder should be send to people instead of unpolite answer 
"To me  the biggest technical problem was having different sources of communication, need of lots of different tools but mainly for the calendar. The calendar we had was great until it was not updated anymore. Additionally a ""dynamic"" calender that you can link with your phone/personal calendar would have been great. 

Mobile App was apperantly not sufficient but I know it is an ongoing process, so I skip the app related feedback.

About the operational manners, what I missed the most was the ""community spirit"". I was expecting more collaboration with the alumnis and the students. Some responsibilities could have given to a ""team"" of ambassadors or alumnis maybe instead of having just one person. An extended team cooperating with Jelena and distributing the responsibilities and communication would have made her also way more efficient and keep the interactions smoother. That's why related to this topic again; having study groups, practice week captains, work groups,  operational team etc. kind of ideas would create a self sufficient and dynamic community which would operate smoothly with combination of great help from dedicated (crazy) people like Jelena :) "
