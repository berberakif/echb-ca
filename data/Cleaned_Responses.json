":"As per my email sent on May.\n\nTraining Weeks\nOne of the most important periods, the Program offers in my opinion and thank you for this opportunity.\n- Each Team\/Coach has different approach to this, which somehow doesn't make it fair to everyone. For example Weeks in Real, Partizan, Monaco and Red Star, as far as I know, were by far the best.\nI suggest you set a minimum of specific things that a Team\/Coach can offer to the students that participate. For example:\nAt least one Scouting\/VIdeo Session.\nTime spent with Players and Coaching Staff.\nAt least one member of the Coaching Staff or a member of EHCB who would be in charge to explain what is happening during the practices.\nMeetings and spend time with other departments of groups of people that a Head Coach is cooperating with like physios, doctors, management team.\nTour in the locker rooms and the facilities.\nDuring the games seats near the bench in order for the students to have a better picture of ingame coaching.\nMy experience with Olympiacos, as we had already informed you back then, was not what we were expecting.\nWe were standing behind the baseline just watching the sessions, no one from the EHCB or the coaching staff was there to explain anything to us, except the last day at the end of the practice.\nWe did not have any video sessions or meetings with players.\n\nI would suggest agreeing with each Coach and each team about the period of the weeks that they will be more beneficial. For example, there are Coaches, like Coach Bartzokas, that maybe they would prefer to have the students during the preseason. It is something that Coach Bartzokas also suggested.\n\nThe most unpleasant was when one day when everyone had left the stadium, one of the students (who probably privately asked coach Triantafyllos), had a private Scouting\/Video session for about 40-45 minutes, with scouting reports provided etc.\nHe did share everything with us, and I thank him, but it is totally different than having a session with a member of the coaching staff.\nObviously, it was a genuine mistake and not something intentionally.","How effective were the panels and masterclasses at the Congress?":5.0,"How valuable was the networking opportunity provided at the Congress?":3.0,"Did you find the certification ceremony satisfactory?

":"As per my email sent on May.\n\nTraining Weeks\nOne of the most important periods, the Program offers in my opinion and thank you for this opportunity.\n- Each Team\/Coach has different approach to this, which somehow doesn't make it fair to everyone. For example Weeks in Real, Partizan, Monaco and Red Star, as far as I know, were by far the best.\nI suggest you set a minimum of specific things that a Team\/Coach can offer to the students that participate. For example:\nAt least one Scouting\/VIdeo Session.\nTime spent with Players and Coaching Staff.\nAt least one member of the Coaching Staff or a member of EHCB who would be in charge to explain what is happening during the practices.\nMeetings and spend time with other departments of groups of people that a Head Coach is cooperating with like physios, doctors, management team.\nTour in the locker rooms and the facilities.\nDuring the games seats near the bench in order for the students to have a better picture of ingame coaching.\nMy experience with Olympiacos, as we had already informed you back then, was not what we were expecting.\nWe were standing behind the baseline just watching the sessions, no one from the EHCB or the coaching staff was there to explain anything to us, except the last day at the end of the practice.\nWe did not have any video sessions or meetings with players.\n\nI would suggest agreeing with each Coach and each team about the period of the weeks that they will be more beneficial. For example, there are Coaches, like Coach Bartzokas, that maybe they would prefer to have the students during the preseason. It is something that Coach Bartzokas also suggested.\n\nThe most unpleasant was when one day when everyone had left the stadium, one of the students (who probably privately asked coach Triantafyllos), had a private Scouting\/Video session for about 40-45 minutes, with scouting reports provided etc.\nHe did share everything with us, and I thank him, but it is totally different than having a session with a member of the coaching staff.\nObviously, it was a genuine mistake and not something intentionally.","How effective were the panels and masterclasses at the Congress?":4.6,"How valuable was the networking opportunity provided at the Congress?":4.3703703704,"Did you find the certification ceremony satisfactory?

For example Weeks in Real, Partizan, Monaco and Red Star, as far as I know, were by far the best.\nI suggest you set a minimum of specific things that a Team\/Coach can offer to the students that participate. For example:\nAt least one Scouting\/VIdeo Session.\nTime spent with Players and Coaching Staff.\nAt least one member of the Coaching Staff or a member of EHCB who would be in charge to explain what is happening during the practices.\nMeetings and spend time with other departments of groups of people that a Head Coach is cooperating with like physios, doctors, management team.\nTour in the locker rooms and the facilities.\nDuring the games seats near the bench in order for the students to have a better picture of ingame coaching.\nMy experience with Olympiacos, as we had already informed you back then, was not what we were expecting.\nWe were standing behind the baseline just watching the sessions, no one from the EHCB or the coaching staff was there to explain anything to us, except the last day at the end of the practice.\nWe did not have any video sessions or meetings with players.\n\nI would suggest agreeing with each Coach and each team about the period of the weeks that they will be more beneficial. For example, there are Coaches, like Coach Bartzokas, that maybe they would prefer to have the students during the preseason. It is something that Coach Bartzokas also suggested.\n\nThe most unpleasant was when one day when everyone had left the stadium, one of the students (who probably privately asked coach Triantafyllos), had a private Scouting\/Video session for about 40-45 minutes, with scouting reports provided etc.\nHe did share everything with us, and I thank him, but it is totally different than having a session with a member of the coaching staff.\nObviously, it was a genuine mistake and not something intentionally.","How effective were the panels and masterclasses at the Congress?":5.0,"How valuable was the networking opportunity provided at the Congress?":5.0,"Did you find the certification ceremony satisfactory?

For example Weeks in Real, Partizan, Monaco and Red Star, as far as I know, were by far the best.\nI suggest you set a minimum of specific things that a Team\/Coach can offer to the students that participate. For example:\nAt least one Scouting\/VIdeo Session.\nTime spent with Players and Coaching Staff.\nAt least one member of the Coaching Staff or a member of EHCB who would be in charge to explain what is happening during the practices.\nMeetings and spend time with other departments of groups of people that a Head Coach is cooperating with like physios, doctors, management team.\nTour in the locker rooms and the facilities.\nDuring the games seats near the bench in order for the students to have a better picture of ingame coaching.\nMy experience with Olympiacos, as we had already informed you back then, was not what we were expecting.\nWe were standing behind the baseline just watching the sessions, no one from the EHCB or the coaching staff was there to explain anything to us, except the last day at the end of the practice.\nWe did not have any video sessions or meetings with players.\n\nI would suggest agreeing with each Coach and each team about the period of the weeks that they will be more beneficial. For example, there are Coaches, like Coach Bartzokas, that maybe they would prefer to have the students during the preseason. It is something that Coach Bartzokas also suggested.\n\nThe most unpleasant was when one day when everyone had left the stadium, one of the students (who probably privately asked coach Triantafyllos), had a private Scouting\/Video session for about 40-45 minutes, with scouting reports provided etc.\nHe did share everything with us, and I thank him, but it is totally different than having a session with a member of the coaching staff.\nObviously, it was a genuine mistake and not something intentionally.","How effective were the panels and masterclasses at the Congress?":5.0,"How valuable was the networking opportunity provided at the Congress?":5.0,"Did you find the certification ceremony satisfactory?

Leave them as they are, do not add or change anything. For example, the last month of academy was very busy and dynamic with the lessons and Q&A sessions, bonus lectures, etc, because many of them were cancelled during the course. The last day of congress should be the last day for all activities at the academy.

For example Weeks in Real, Partizan, Monaco and Red Star, as far as I know, were by far the best.\nI suggest you set a minimum of specific things that a Team\/Coach can offer to the students that participate. For example:\nAt least one Scouting\/VIdeo Session.\nTime spent with Players and Coaching Staff.\nAt least one member of the Coaching Staff or a member of EHCB who would be in charge to explain what is happening during the practices.\nMeetings and spend time with other departments of groups of people that a Head Coach is cooperating with like physios, doctors, management team.\nTour in the locker rooms and the facilities.\nDuring the games seats near the bench in order for the students to have a better picture of ingame coaching.\nMy experience with Olympiacos, as we had already informed you back then, was not what we were expecting.\nWe were standing behind the baseline just watching the sessions, no one from the EHCB or the coaching staff was there to explain anything to us, except the last day at the end of the practice.\nWe did not have any video sessions or meetings with players.\n\nI would suggest agreeing with each Coach and each team about the period of the weeks that they will be more beneficial. For example, there are Coaches, like Coach Bartzokas, that maybe they would prefer to have the students during the preseason. It is something that Coach Bartzokas also suggested.\n\nThe most unpleasant was when one day when everyone had left the stadium, one of the students (who probably privately asked coach Triantafyllos), had a private Scouting\/Video session for about 40-45 minutes, with scouting reports provided etc.\nHe did share everything with us, and I thank him, but it is totally different than having a session with a member of the coaching staff.\nObviously, it was a genuine mistake and not something intentionally.","How effective were the panels and masterclasses at the Congress?":4.6,"How valuable was the networking opportunity provided at the Congress?":4.3703703704,"Did you find the certification ceremony satisfactory?

The program's structure, with a mix of online lectures and in-person sessions, allowed us to balance our daily work while advancing our coaching skills.\n\nThe academic partnership with the University of Belgrade and the involvement of EHCB members have elevated the quality of education, making it one of the premier coaching programs globally. The EHCB Coaches Congress, as reported by my peers, featured engaging panel discussions, masterclasses, and invaluable networking opportunities.\n\nI highly recommend the EHCB Coaches Academy to anyone serious about advancing their coaching career.

And collecting the questions already maybe one week before from the students and share them with everyone so everyone can rate the questions, then the best rated ones are directed to the coaches.  ","What kind of interactivity would you prefer from the professors?":"Direct questions to the students, Instant questions allowed, Questions in the end or seperate session, More like a video cast, one way communication to watch it later, Everyone has their own style, but if there is no change in the content or no interactivity is needed then maybe better to just have the video of the topic explained by teachers. Then after everyone watches that video, a live questions\/answers session with the teacher would be more efficient. And maybe one more session after the \u201cquiz\u201d. Then the challenge of \u201chaving coaches with very different knowledge level\u201d would be tackled a bit more. ","Which module\/lesson would you like to add to the curriculum?":"Sport Management, Sports Psychology, Sports Technology, Pedagogy","Please share any additional comments or suggestions about the Curriculum. ":"Maybe something like a \"graduation project\" could be added to the curriculum. Probably not possible to do it per individuals but for the first year, as a trial, pre-defined projects are offered to everyone then everyone selects one  from the topics (S&C, Psychology, Technology, Anatomy, Scouting...). Some of them could be even related to the Academy itself. Helping the staff from technical perspective or operational perspective might be a good experience for the students as well (IT work group, Practice Weeks work group, Congress Work group etc.). Or the students come up with ideas\/proposals. This would create a real self sufficient community, more hands on experiences, more interactions, more impact to everyone and in my opinion would be more chance to teach everyone from the youngest coach to the most experienced national team level coaches. It would create more internship or even finding a job kind of chances in natural and mutual way. \n\nContent\/topic wise I liked the curriculum. It was covering almost everything. Whatever would be there, there will be always \"this is also important, should be in the curriculum\" kind of critisizm. On top of the ones I added above, I would also like to see more \"futuristic\" topics (some experimental defenses, some unorthodox spacing ideas or the way of technology usage in NBA like leagues, latest academic studies on timing or mental health or you name it) as well for example. But I also strongly believe that having a nice stable curriculum and the foundation of the academy and then shaping it without rushing is the best way to create the excellence. So that's why I really liked that everything was based on Yugoslavian school and decided by the academicians of its representatives. However, I would shape it in a way that it covers both \"old school\" and \"new school\" if I can summarize roughly like that. And the way of managing it is keeping the foundation for sure, while adding different perspectives. That's why maybe instead of having the lectures as \"whole package\" from the Belgrade University, spreading this curriculum to the whole europe and all different \"basketball schools\" in Europe. \n\n  ","How effective were the lessons on Offensive Team Tactic?":3,"Did the exam adequately assess your knowledge in Offensive Team Tactic?":3,"How effective were the lessons on Defensive Team Tactic?
