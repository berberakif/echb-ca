They way how you organize that was an amazing.

Take into considerations the teams schedule and national holidays. 
I was part of Madrid group great experience ones in life... üèÄüèÄüèÄ
"This was an unreal experience. I got to bond with my peers in a different way, and they were a big help in my experience outside of the court."

It would be great if we had much more interaction with assistant coaches about their role in the team. 
I didnt participate for Practice weeks
Probably it can be a big help if the host club can help with the local transportation.
Make more in Russia)
"I had miss my Week, I had a job interview in the US (I got the job)"
I didn't participate in the practice weeks because I didn't have the means to travel and stay in Europe
I didn't join any practice but I did it on previous generations in Belgrade and Madrid 
I was not able to attend practice week because I live in another continent
Please do more efforts to help coach get their VISA  to attend practice week and congress 
I live in Greece and due to my heavy daily schedule I couldn‚Äôt participate in out of court experiences and cannot judge correctly the travel‚Äôs accommodations etc
More structured 
"I was expecting to be more involved in the practice week. we were basically just watching the training sessions of the team, which was very good to watch, but I‚Äôve heard that in some other practice weeks the coaching staff spend more time to talk with EHCB coaches about basketball, had an extra gathering to talk about basketball. in general the practice week could be much more useful‚Ä¶
Anyway I know that Efes team was in a hard situation at that time, but we were traveling from different countries around the world to attend that practice week, and were expecting more of that‚Ä¶ Meeting with coach Erdem √ßan and spending time in his training sessions was very good.
By the way meeting with coach Ahmet √ßaki for 1 session was really great.
Best regards,,"
"I supposed to be in Zenit, but couldn't make it. I mark 3 on everything bcuz of that.
I'll be happy to join one next season if I can "
I didn't participate
Would love to attend other practice weeks as an Alumni/Ambassador next years
"Great experience, probably would be even better if there was 3-5 coaches visiting, not 10-ish. But I know it is very hard to organise it with less number of coaches, because of the number of participants. "
It was a good experience!
"I think the best time is during the pre-season, during the build-up of the teams."
"I had the feeling a lot of our week was on short notice and also the meeting with ≈Ωalgiris Academy responsibles  was, if I‚Äôm not mistaken, organised by a fellow student. Those things could/should be part of the practice week too (IF a EuroLeague team runs such a academy). "
you should announce what should be expected points to have during the practice week and work on making these points happen
If someone missed a practice week a good way would be to try and get them to attend one at a later date.
"I have one of the best practice week,thank Goran for that!"
"Unbelievable experience, I still talk about those days and would do it all again next year :-)"
"Due to work reasons, I could not use the chance to practice week, and Jelena assured me that I can use this quota next year."
Every city needs to have alumni which will be kind a tourist guide during Practice week. His/her task must be to prepare all relevant informations about the city where Practive week is held.
it would be many 
It was a strange week for the team so didn‚Äôt make the most of it. Also took a whole week off work but we only really needed two days
I didn‚Äôt participate
"As per my email sent on May.

Training Weeks
One of the most important periods, the Program offers in my opinion and thank you for this opportunity.
- Each Team/Coach has different approach to this, which somehow doesn't make it fair to everyone. For example Weeks in Real, Partizan, Monaco and Red Star, as far as I know, were by far the best.
I suggest you set a minimum of specific things that a Team/Coach can offer to the students that participate. For example:
At least one Scouting/VIdeo Session.
Time spent with Players and Coaching Staff.
At least one member of the Coaching Staff or a member of EHCB who would be in charge to explain what is happening during the practices.
Meetings and spend time with other departments of groups of people that a Head Coach is cooperating with like physios, doctors, management team.
Tour in the locker rooms and the facilities.
During the games seats near the bench in order for the students to have a better picture of ingame coaching.
My experience with Olympiacos, as we had already informed you back then, was not what we were expecting.
We were standing behind the baseline just watching the sessions, no one from the EHCB or the coaching staff was there to explain anything to us, except the last day at the end of the practice.
We did not have any video sessions or meetings with players.

I would suggest agreeing with each Coach and each team about the period of the weeks that they will be more beneficial. For example, there are Coaches, like Coach Bartzokas, that maybe they would prefer to have the students during the preseason. It is something that Coach Bartzokas also suggested.

The most unpleasant was when one day when everyone had left the stadium, one of the students (who probably privately asked coach Triantafyllos), had a private Scouting/Video session for about 40-45 minutes, with scouting reports provided etc.
He did share everything with us, and I thank him, but it is totally different than having a session with a member of the coaching staff.
Obviously, it was a genuine mistake and not something intentionally."
Maybe Is some of student has no chance to attend practice week during the season it‚Äôs could be as option to implement also practice week with some national team during the summer. Let‚Äôs say in my case I would join some national team in the summer to watch and learn.
I was unable to attend a practice week due to the scheduling of my academy. 
Practice week was amazing thanks to real Madrid staff but we couldn't get clarity in terms of time before starting
"I saw two complete different parts of practice weeks. One was very well organized and with a  dedicated representative from EHCB (Real Madrid with Goran) and the other one was not organized at all and without a dedicated representative from EHCB (Panathinaikos). I will just repeat my suggestion for the sake of being recorded: there should be a check list of things what can teams/coaches offer to the visitor students and what they cannot. Then at least everyone can know upfront what they should expect. From Pao week, personally I already had expected no more communication than what we had (basically Hi & Bye only) with Coach Ataman but I think it is a shame that we couldn't even had a simple Q&A session with him. This kind of details (making him available) are the ""exclusiveness"" feeling that EHCB should try to create for their students. 

But anyways I enjoyed both experiences A LOT from all dimensions. Interaction with assistent coaches of both teams, Coach Mateo, all co-students and Goran was amazing. Lunch with Coach Itoudis was a great additional surprise. "
