"Please share any additional comments or suggestions about Lecture Modules, exam, grading and certification "
I have already gave some advices.
Please add workshops for academy members during congress 
Hard to assess open book exams. 
Maybe more videos example for a individual tehnique and tactic and everything... Less Ppt text more videos and examples from practice 
"I think some exams should be based on game situations in regards to be more related to our day to day activities. Maybe , we could do some season planning or game planning to show how we apply our subjects learning on our real life. I suggest promote one subject as technology on basketball.

Generally speaking, I loved be part of it , and I learned a lot."
I wouldve liked a grade list
can't add at the moment 
"I believe the lessons, power point slides and exams were executed very well and organized amazingly. "
/
I liked the format of the exams but the timetable of them should be more relaxed and flexible.
Mostly useless or very poorly delivered (courses and exams)
Improve technical side of exams) 
"Too much high level information shared over a short period of time, and taking the  test did not necessarily mean that I understood what I was talking about. "
"Sometimes the professors were hard to understand. It is also tough to sit and listen to the computer for maybe 90 minutes.
Shorter sessions might be more helpful. It sometimes got a little repetitive. But I have great respect for the professors and their knowledge. It was an honor listening to them. "
"In my opinion, many lectures was extremely hard, I had the feeling that in one lecture it was to much information, and the the best will be to keep them more simple. The feeling was that in one lecture it was a content of a whole semester even for me that I finished a Sport university and I’m familiar with most subjects, still it was too much for one lecture. Don’t get me wrong the lectures was amazing, but what I’m saying for people that are not familiar with most of the subjects I think it was too hard for them to follow."
An on line test what we can solve when we have time
"Everything regarding the lectures Modules, exam, grading and certificate am satisfied "
"We could have more moments with interactions between us, we spend a lot of time in online classes and we didn't have the opportunity to know about some friends. Some of the lectures was not that important for us bit even that I think it's important to be there. My suggestion would be add how we teach, learning process, different protocols and methods of learning... we have that but more important than teach basketball is to teach how to play basketball."
Each exam period should be communicated by EHCB CA
"Instead of exams, maybe something like homework / presentation about some specific topic"
None
I really like all . Thank you 
"I expected a bit more depth of all the above mentioned topics. But given the time available for each topic it may have been accurate afterall. If I reminisce through each module though, I remember that we talked about very generic things"
"I think we need to check the knowledge of the subject but not only with tests. It will be more difficult for students but i think we need some tasks to do,to understand the subject more"
"Very impressed with the content of the lectures, maybe it will be better to improve the lectures to something more dynamic and interactive. Also would be better to change exams for group homework or simply adding this homework to the exams"
"Some topics needed to be presented in the basketball court, such as one on one or defense topics, and it was more like reading from articles and it was not pleasant.  And in each topic, the differences between women, men and youth should be separated.  In addition, we did not know to attend some classes and now we have some questions.  I wish a way to express questions and receive answers from EuroLeague professors and coaches would be designed after the course."
The exam should have been done in another way. Very easy and not a good way to test knowledge
"Examination could be in form of situations solution. As I said previously, explaining some topic related things, discussing. To try to find answers based on the content that was learnt."
"same like in my previous comments, it depends about what should be an final outcome of all of it. From my perspective, the approach of profs was totally great and really professional. the amount and spectre of information, topics and everything was like when I would apply to study for our A licence basketball certification at Charles University in our country. I really did not see the difference, maybe it is better to tell that this was much better and effective. But in the end of the day I have to say that this certification unfortunately not mean much because its holder ain’t approve for nothing after receiving and I mean this  totally uncritically. But from that perspective I pragmatically have to say it is not possible to demand serious study approach from students and this could be definitely different."
"It should be clarified whether the exams are a requirement or optional. Modules are interesting but perhaps videos should be sent out and calls if students have questions. Additionally, some of the presentations sent by the professors were badly formatted making it impossible to  read due to animations in the ppt"
"Questions and answers during the exams, where copied and pasted excactly how they were written in the slides. This makes it easy to find the answers just by searching, which does not help those that want to cheat.

As mentioned before, may coaches have already studied physical education and sports science, even with expertise in Basketball coaching and they already have been tought what University lectures offered.

Exams should have more importance in order someone to get the certification or not.


From my email earlier this May:
Dates and times of lectures, Q&A sessions and Tests were not always updated, which caused a bit of confusion and a lot of spamming on the chat. Many messages were lost in the group chat because of irrelevant messages that could have been sent privately.
- Teams should have been the second source of checking for the Tests' deadlines, since we had a link of Exam Topics-Dates. I have missed one test unfortunately. The one I asked you the questions which were included.
- Regarding missing Tests, I suggest adding from the next season, a week or 10 days when you can open all tests for those that have missed one or more. It is more fair than extending the deadline just for a few tests, because someone asked for it. Personally, when I missed the test, I accepted the consequences. I just wanted to know the questions that the test had for my personal use."
Sometimes the wording of the exam questions were not clear in wanting more than one answer which resulted in lost marks. I am aware that English is a 2nd language though so this is not a big problem. 
Lecture were most of the time professor reading their own slide and no any other knowledge were shared except for what is written
"Exams should be changed in my opinion. Good exams would force you to learn and make a research as well. Just having the exact answer from the presentations is just improving your document searching skills :) Additionally every lesson should have a ""priority to teach"". The time is limited, so no one can cover the whole anatomy for example in two lessons. Maybe the teachers can still provide the material for everything, be open for all kind of questions from the whole content of the topic but they should prioritize what whould be tought and what should be asked in the exams. Then it could be measured easier.
