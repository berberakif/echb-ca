Please share any additional comments or suggestions about the Bonus Lectures. 
The Bonus Lectures were outstanding 
I would like to have topic based and practical lectures and then move to questions and answers
Nice option to have for the enthusiasts that want to learn more. 
Perfect coaches great lectures all the best...
no
Taking into considerations how busy head coaches are it is difficult to have it all planned out ahead so i think the organization part was amazing together with the fact that we could download the bonus lectures and rewatch them was absolutely great for me.
Great addition to the course. I like the variety of coaches who gave a lecture.
Make them longer)
The Joe Mazzula q and a was the best of all the lectures. 
appreciate Jelena's effort and thankful to every coach that talked with us.  
Bonus lectures should remain a permanent offer at EHCB CA
"it would be great to have multiple experts to cover the same topic eg. player development, just to compare how each coach/team handles it different. Maybe split the bonus lectures in modules too? Offensive/defensive team tactics, player development, leadership, etc"
They really opened up my mind to coaching aspects and skill
I would love to have more of them. Any extra knowledge and opportunities to share basketball and learn from other coaches is always welcomed and a gift for anyone
"Love the idea of it, but missing more structured approach, now is like more ad hoc and shock dropping to me and it’s not fit much to me because of daily business. When I will be 15 years younger students, I wouldn’t mind, but life of 36 years old working man needs longer period schedules"
"Great topics, great guests. Short notice makes it difficult to follow but I appreciate this is down to the guests"
"I liked the lectures a lot even though I couldn't attend most of them. But to me it didn't look professional to ask extra money and create some ""exclusiveness"" in the Academy. I would prefer having those lectures already part of the Academy lessons and if needed paying that extra together with the Academy fee. "
