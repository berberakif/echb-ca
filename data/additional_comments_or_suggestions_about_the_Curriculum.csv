Please share any additional comments or suggestions about the Curriculum. 
Would be great to add on Court Lectures concerning Athletic Training 
Strenght and conditioning as an important part of basketball should be more basketball oriented and more practical than theoritical. It has to be simple in order for is coaches to u derstand it and implement it better
"As I said before, maybe content and especially professors can inquire participants to do more during class. Try to make some quizes, Q&A live, try to find solutions for situations, try to give some videos to analyze live, talk about mistakes in their answers and etc. More communication and activities during lessons. Instead of talking a lot and waiting for questions at the end."
"Look for a partner for scouting software, video editing. And a course about that . You can ask Gabor to do it. He tought me how to do it when we were in Berlin "
Good mix of lectures for youth and senior levels. A suggestion could be to add sports psychology for the coaches (mental health for the coaches). 
For me everything was on top level üèÄüèÄüèÄ
Some of the medical/physical went into a lot of small detail that realistically no coach would ever need to know.
Technology applied to basketball 
"it s a growing part of our world ,so this is why I choose media prep "
"As a youth coach i found it difficult to implement some of the things learned from the lectures although very helpful for future use in my career, I would love to see more specific lectures on youth development even for 10-year-olds. I believe it will help a lot more coaches like me and guide them through on how to structure their season and sessions when coaching younger kids.  Getting knowledge from the best coaches in the world who went through those stages to get to where they are now would be amazing."

"Medical lessons should be in relation to the sport rather than theoreticall. Also, i think that S&C lessons should have less hours in curriculum and you may add individual training lessons instead."
"Too many non basketball related topics. The courses/presentations from the University were horrible although the professors were committed to help. The academic basketball lectures were very basic. Presenters were reading the slides most of the time. Low value.

The video platform was good. Every basketball topics from couches are appreciated and the chance of asking them questions is great."
more scouting lectures as is the base for new coaches to take job
/
"For lectures slides and topics are almost identical, I would suggest for speakers to be more free (don‚Äôt just repeat slides). 
For not basketball lectures (nutrition for example) it would be great to have some kind of translate)))
Adding more coaches who works individually with pro players and some topics from them also would be great
Adding pro apps for scouts and teaching how to use them, maybe have some discounts or account for them to use
Add some free-talk calls without lectures and topics, just to talk
"
"Sharing of more specific content, for instance if the topic is scouting we can discuss an actual scout report or player for that matter "
"It was good. really, it was good. "
There was some lectures so basic for the level of the coaching academy.
"When talking about basketball, professors could propose a topic, tactic situation, time out... and the students have to decide what they do in that situation, and discuss that decision with the professor or EHCB coaches. "
"Since not all the coaches are professionals and working only in adult level, I would suggest to adjust some lectures about youth level coaching strengthening and planning"
Video register from a practice from every coach. 
Sport Event Management and Marketing 
Each exam period should be announced by EHCB CA
None
Team work by students ( groups) like lectures about some specific topics
"Sport psychology about mental resilience would be highly interesting since it‚Äôs a topic more and more people become aware of. Since I studied sports management & now I‚Äôm trying to get into coaching on a higher level as well, this could be a very intriguing option. Maybe even give participants the option to choose additional modules like Sport Management, or Psychology  "
I will add more scouting as it is a very interesting and useful thing in coaching 
"Maybe medical module is not as useful as others, academy lectures about this topic are more than enough. EHCB members lectures to be topic based, so we can see their vision and knowledge where they are the best and most comfortable with. Of course, some Q&A are welcome and necessary. Also adding analytics module and player development lectures will be great"
"3*3 topic.
In each topic, the differences between youth and adults and male and female athletes should be stated.  For example, in the topic of sports nutrition, s&c and..."
"Professors could do more interactions during lessons. Try to solve some situations during live class. Find answers with students, discuss more."
"Generally I would say same things like in previous part. More demanding, more interactive, more serious for the students"
Finance/data analytics
If the goal of EHCB is to have a big number of student is almost impossible to do open lecture with Q/A cause not everyone can ask questions. So general lecture to explain and discuss the topic and questions send via email would be more efficent
"Maybe something like a ""graduation project"" could be added to the curriculum. Probably not possible to do it per individuals but for the first year, as a trial, pre-defined projects are offered to everyone then everyone selects one  from the topics (S&C, Psychology, Technology, Anatomy, Scouting...). Some of them could be even related to the Academy itself. Helping the staff from technical perspective or operational perspective might be a good experience for the students as well (IT work group, Practice Weeks work group, Congress Work group etc.). Or the students come up with ideas/proposals. This would create a real self sufficient community, more hands on experiences, more interactions, more impact to everyone and in my opinion would be more chance to teach everyone from the youngest coach to the most experienced national team level coaches. It would create more internship or even finding a job kind of chances in natural and mutual way. 

Content/topic wise I liked the curriculum. It was covering almost everything. Whatever would be there, there will be always ""this is also important, should be in the curriculum"" kind of critisizm. On top of the ones I added above, I would also like to see more ""futuristic"" topics (some experimental defenses, some unorthodox spacing ideas or the way of technology usage in NBA like leagues, latest academic studies on timing or mental health or you name it) as well for example. But I also strongly believe that having a nice stable curriculum and the foundation of the academy and then shaping it without rushing is the best way to create the excellence. So that's why I really liked that everything was based on Yugoslavian school and decided by the academicians of its representatives. However, I would shape it in a way that it covers both ""old school"" and ""new school"" if I can summarize roughly like that. And the way of managing it is keeping the foundation for sure, while adding different perspectives. That's why maybe instead of having the lectures as ""whole package"" from the Belgrade University, spreading this curriculum to the whole europe and all different ""basketball schools"" in Europe.
